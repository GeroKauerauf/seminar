\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:state-of-the-art}

Modern neural network implementations such as Keras in TensorFlow \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} are used in a broad variety of fields.
They got in fact so popular, that almost everybody has heard of them.
They have been on a rise for the last 40 years and it seems like this trend is not going to stop anytime soon.
With computers getting constantly faster, the number of fields in which neural networks can be used also increases.

Especially in the last years, there has been a huge interest and development in neural networks.
Modern optimization algorithms such as \emph{Ftrl} \cite{McMahan} and new activation functions like \emph{swish} \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1710-05941} by Google are increasing the power of even more.
