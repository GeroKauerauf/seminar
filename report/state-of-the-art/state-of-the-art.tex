\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:state-of-the-art}

Modern neural network implementations such as Keras in TensorFlow \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} are used in a broad variety of fields.
Research interest in neural networks is on a rise for the last 40 years and it seems like this trend is not going to stop anytime soon.
With computers getting constantly faster and new different types of neural networks coming up, the number of fields in which neural networks are used also increases.

Especially in the last years, there has been a huge interest and development in convolutional neural network.
Modern optimization algorithms such as \emph{Ftrl} \cite{McMahan} and new activation functions like \emph{swish} \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1710-05941} by Google are increasing the performance of them even more.
