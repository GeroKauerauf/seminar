\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As you might have already guessed: Neural networks are used because they are doing what other algorithms struggle with.
For certain problem classes, they are the best we currently have.
It is not a question of choice either, since there is simply no good alternative to them.
However, we should keep in mind that they should not be \enquote{over-used}.
For problems for which we have good algorithms, we do not need neural networks.

A real problem with neural networks however is, that they are really practical.
What I mean by that is, that its most often a \enquote{trial and error} with neural networks.
You simply test what works well and stick with that.
Theoretically analyzing why it works well, is most of the time incredibly laborious and very complicated.
