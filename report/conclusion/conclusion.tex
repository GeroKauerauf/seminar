\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Neural networks are used because they are doing what other algorithms struggle with.
For certain problem classes, they are the best we currently have.
It is not a question of choice either, since there is simply no good alternative to them.
However, we should keep in mind that they should not be \enquote{over-used}.
For problems for which we have good algorithms, we do not need neural networks.

A real problem with neural networks however is their practical nature.
It is often a \enquote{trial and error} to determine what works well.
Theoretically analyzing why it works well, is most of the time incredibly laborious and very complex.
