\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this paper, we elaborate on the main algorithms used for training neural networks.
We especially lay focus on \emph{feedforward networks} and \emph{supervised learing}, for which we describe these algorithms in great detail.
For better understanding, this paper itself is structured in the same order the algorithms and methods to train are used in.
Key elements are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structure of \emph{feedforward networks} and \emph{forward propagation}
    \item \emph{Cost functions} and \emph{computational graphs} for these networks
    \item \emph{Backward-propagation}
    \item \emph{Stochastic gradient descent}
\end{itemize}
We make use of examples and graphics at key points for better understanding.
Furthermore, we have simplified unnecessary complex practical parts, that are not essential for a fundamental understanding.
This paper is mostly based on the standard textbook by \textbf{Goodfellow et al.} \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.
